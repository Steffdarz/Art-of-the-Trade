                <h1>Trading Routine & Goal Setting</h1>
                <p>"Trading is more than just placing individual trades; being a trader means developing the right mindset, process, and discipline to perform consistently at a higher level"</p>
            </section>
            
            <!-- Intro section -->

                <h2>The Foundation: Routine and Goal Setting - My Turning Point</h2>
                <p>For me, this is really key. Routine and goal setting build nicely upon the ideas of having a process and managing psychology. They provide a level of organization and structure, helping you work towards a clear path for the week ahead and each day. If you're trading full-time, you need a very clear objective.</p>
                
                <p>One of the biggest changes in my own trading career over the last 9 years was implementing a process, and a crucial part of that process is routine and setting goals for the week ahead. I started implementing a routine back in 2019, and for me, that was the turning point. It gave me a purpose in terms of trading the markets.</p>
                
                <div class="quote">
                    I stopped being impulsive in my trading. I had a clear plan for which markets I was looking to trade.
                </div>
                
                <p>I strongly believe that as a trader, you need a monthly, weekly, and daily routine. This level of organization and structure with pre-market preparation is essential each and every day. It helps you set clear, realistic goals for the week and each day.</p>
                
                <p>You then understand the difference between a process-oriented approach versus just being outcome-focused. You want to strive towards that level where you understand your purpose in trading.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Trading as a Professional Endeavor - My Approach</h2>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h3>Business Mindset</h3>
                    <p>To succeed at a high level, I have to approach trading the way professionals approach it. That means <span class="key-point">treating it like a business</span>. I'm the CEO, the strategist, the person responsible for executing trades.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Most of the real work isn't just clicking buttons; it's actually outside of market hours, particularly on the weekend, when I'm reviewing my process and my journal. I have a routine for that, and I have to follow that routine and structure. I think of it like a professional sport.</p>
                
                <div class="quote">
                    There are no shortcuts; I've got to study, refine my edge, show up, and bring the best version of myself every single day to that desk.
                </div>
                
                <p>After trading, I need to reflect on how I traded, do an end-of-day review, an end-of-week review, go over my journal, and go over my statistics. If you're not recording your statistics, how are you ever going to have accountability and track your progress? You'll never understand your expected value or expectancy per trade.</p>
                
                <h3>The Power of Routine: Consistency, Confidence, and Measurable Progress - My Experience</h3>
                
                <p>Why is a routine so powerful? Because it helps me build consistency in my trading. It gives me structure and builds confidence in my ability. I start seeing progress, tracking it, and seeing results to improve upon. I start to understand what went well each day, and then at the end of the week and month.</p>
                
                <div class="key-points">
                    <p>A consistent trading routine really helps remove large parts of that randomness from my process. It's helped me build confidence over the years.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>I know my best setups, like trading around range extremities, where price often ranges 70-80% of the time. I have a very clearly defined expected value trading range extremities now.</p>
                
                <p>Without expectancy, you can't really scale up a strategy or your performance because then you're trading off emotions, which can't be scaled. Structure and consistency aren't just habits; they fuel the long-term success of the journey.</p>
                
                <p>To make real progress, I have to operate with a clear objective. Keeping the end goal in mind is important, but I also need to focus on the path – building realistic expectancy and understanding my edge. If one of my aims is to get into a prop firm, I'll need a track record. To make that progression, I need to show my results and performance. I build this track record step by step, day by day; having a clear structure and journaling my process is key.</p>

                    <p>A critical daily check is my current risk and exposure against my defined limits for the day and week. If I've breached my weekly drawdown limit, I have to stop trading and review what went wrong.</p>

                        <li>Checking trading templates, liquidity zones, momentum oscillators</li>
                        <li>Assessing market context (ranging, trending, volatility)</li>
                        <li>Book depth and volume analysis</li>
                        <li>Building situational awareness by playing out "what if" scenarios</li>

                <p>This detailed analysis helps me define trade expectations (mean reversion, breakout). Going through this takes me a good half an hour to 60 minutes. This structured approach ensures I'm not trading purely off emotion or impulsiveness.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>For myself, I'm always looking for ways to improve through reflection</li>
                    <li>Daily planning and reflection are non-negotiables in my process</li>
                    <li>If my routine is disorganized, it's going to show up in my trading</li>
                    <li>The key for me is setting my goals, structuring a plan, and building my edge one day at a time</li>
                    <li>Over time, routine reinforces the discipline I need to perform under pressure</li>
                    <li>One strategy I can repeat over and over is trading range extremities, allowing me to become very efficient and profitable</li>
                    <li>Using that process, I can scale up in size because I have the repetitions and the process in place</li>
                    <li>I know my execution and risk management through consistent practice</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="key-points">
                    <p>By solidifying both your weekly and daily structure and aligning it with clear, meaningful goals, you build a framework that supports performance and helps you manage emotions in real time. This is how we start treating trading like a high-performance discipline, day by day, step by step.</p>

                </div>
                
                <p>For myself, I started implementing a routine back in 2019, and that was the turning point. It gave me purpose in trading the markets. I stopped being impulsive in my trading. I had a clear plan for which markets I was looking to trade. The transformation didn't happen overnight, but the consistency of following my process has made all the difference.</p>
