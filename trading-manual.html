                            <p>My mission is to execute my trading process with unwavering discipline, patience, and strict adherence to risk management. I focus on long-term consistency rather than individual trades or short-term gains, believing that success in trading is found in following a structured, proven process. By prioritizing the integrity of my approach over the outcome of each trade, I can navigate the market with clarity and purpose, unaffected by short-term market fluctuations.</p>

                            <p>Achieving success in trading requires a structured, step-by-step approach. My focus is on execution, adaptability, discipline, and scaling efficiently while maintaining consistency. Success is not defined by monetary gains but by my ability to execute with precision, adapt to different market conditions, and perform at a professional level.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The focus is on adhering to a structured trading plan, managing risk effectively, and improving trade quality by avoiding mistakes like overtrading. Adapting to multiple CME futures markets and refining a playbook with market-specific setups will enhance trading flexibility. Execution precision will be improved by minimizing slippage and optimizing decision-making. Emotional discipline will be strengthened to maintain composure in varying market conditions. Performance will be tracked through journaling and analytics to drive improvement. Mastery of the DOM/Ladder will boost market intuition, while position sizing will scale as proficiency and control increase. The ultimate goal is to build a track record for prop firm readiness with consistent execution and high-level trading.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Success will ultimately be measured by my ability to execute consistently, adapt across market conditions, and scale my trading sustainably while maintaining peak performance and meeting the above goals over the next 12 months.</p>
